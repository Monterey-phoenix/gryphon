\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}
\subsection {Overview}
The \mpgt supports \mphoenix users with tools for building MP Code and generating trace graphs calculated from MP code.
The \mpgt consists of the \ggui and the \gtg:\\
\begin{compactitem}
\item The \ggui tool is the graphical interface tool for editing MP Code and for running the \gtg engine to view generated traces.
\item The \gtg tool compiles MP Code into traces that the \ggui can read and graph.\\
\end{compactitem}

\subsection{Compatibility}
\ggui Version 0.3.0 is compatible with \mphoenix Version 4 pre-alpha and \gtg Version 4 pre-alpha.
% \ggui Version 0.3.0 is expected to be compatible with future versions of \mphoenix Version 4.

\section{Installing the \mpgt}
You will need the \ggui and the \gtg.
%  What you need depends on whether you are running Mac/Linux or Windows and the installation approach you choose.
For now, for Mac/Linux: clone \mpgt source code directly from their Git repositories by typing the following:
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\verbbf{git clone https://gitlab.nps.edu/monterey-phoenix/user-interfaces/MP_Gryphon_GUI.git}
\verbbf{git clone https://gitlab.nps.edu/monterey-phoenix/trace-generator.git}
\end{Verbatim}

or
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\verbbf{git clone git@gitlab.nps.edu:monterey-phoenix/user-interfaces/MP_Gryphon_GUI.git}
\verbbf{git clone git@gitlab.nps.edu:monterey-phoenix/trace-generator.git}
\end{Verbatim}

To clone from GitLab you will need to upload your public RSA Key as described at \url{https://gitlab.nps.edu/help/ssh/README.md}.\\

\subsection{Installing Python 3}
Install Python3 if it is not already present. To see if Python3 is already installed, you may type the following at a command prompt and verify that Python Version 3 is present:
\begin{compactitem}
%\item Windows:
%\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
%\verbbf{python --version}
%\end{Verbatim}
\item Mac/Linux:
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\verbbf{python3 --version}
\end{Verbatim}
\end{compactitem}
If not already present, you may download and install Python3 for your system from \url{https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0}.\\
%If installing on Windows, you must check the ``Add Python to PATH'' checkbox when installing Python or you will get an error indicating that Python is not recognized.\\

Linux users may prefer to install Python 3 using their package manager, for example Fedora users might type:
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\verbbf{sudo dnf install python3+}
\end{Verbatim}

\subsection{Installing PyQt5}
The \ggui requires PyQt5.
Please type the following at a command prompt to install PyQt5:
\begin{compactitem}
%\item Windows:
%\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
%\verbbf{python -m pip install PyQt5}
%\end{Verbatim}
\item Mac/Linux:
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\verbbf{python3 -m pip install PyQt5}
\end{Verbatim}
\end{compactitem}

\subsection{Building the \gtg}
If you installed on Linux using the repositories then the \gtg must be built.
First, please install requisites needed for running \verb+make+.
Mac users may be asked to install Command line developer tools, which are required.  Linux users need to install 32-bit CLib and the csh shell. Syntax depends on Linux flavor.  A Fedora dnf example is to type:
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\verbbf{sudo dnf install glibc-devel.i686}
\verbbf{sudo dnf install tcsh.x86_64}
\end{Verbatim}

An Ubuntu apt example is:
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\verbbf{sudo apt install libc6-dev-i386}
\verbbf{sudo apt install csh}
\end{Verbatim}

Build the trace generator engine from a command window by navigating to the \verb+MP_Gryphon_Trace_Generator/RIGAL/src+ directory and typing:
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\verbbf{make}
\end{Verbatim}

\section{Examples}
Please obtain, install, and start the \ggui graphical interface per installation instructions, above.
\subsection{Load and run MP Code Example 1}
In this example we open and run MP Code example 1 at Scope 2, select and adjust trace 2, and save the view as a \verb+.png+ image file.

\begin{compactenum}
\item Under menu control \verb+File | Open MP Code Example+ select example\\
\verb+Example_1_simple_message_flow.mp+.
The MP Code listing will show up in the code editor pane.
\item Set the scope to 2 by adjusting the Scope spinner trace generator control.
\item Run the trace generator engine by pressing the run icon
(\includegraphics[scale=.4]{screenshots/run}).
Three traces will be generated. All three traces will be visble in the trace selection list. The first trace will be visible in the main trace view pane.
\item Select the third trace in the list. This trace will be drawn in the main trace view.
\item Move some nodes as desired by dragging them with the cursor.
\item Export the third trace to a \verb+.png+ file using menu \verb+File | Export Trace...+.
\item If you would like to print your exported traces, you may wish to select menu control \verb+Preferences | Graph Settings | Contrast+ for higher contrast for printing before exporting them. Or select menu control \verb+Preferences | Graph Settings | Custom...+ to configure your own graph view scheme.
\end{compactenum}

\section{Reporting Bugs}
Please report any bugs encountered during operation of the \mpgt.  To assist in diagnosing your bug, please include the following informtion:
\begin{compactitem}
\item The \verb+.mp+ code, Scope number, and selected Trace used when the error occurred.
\item The steps taken that can be used to recreate the error.
\item The version of the \ggui tool used.
\item The Operating System you used.
\end{compactitem}

\section{Post-processing Analysis}
The \ggui tool exports graph data in JSON Graph format (JGF).
This output may be used during post-processing analysis of graph data or for input to third party tools which can accept JGF data as input.
The JGF standard defines names for \verb+graph+, \verb+node+, and \verb+edge+ fields. The \ggui tool extends these fields by including additional information such as graph positioning, the trace \verb+mark+ field, Cubic Bezier edge points for curved edges, and whether nodes are hidden or collapsed.
For more information on JGF please see \url{http://jsongraphformat.info}. For syntax of JSON data exported by the \ggui tool, please use the export command to create your own JSON \verb+.gry+ file and use that as a reference.
